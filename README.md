# Word-Association-Game

this game uses Vanilla Javascript, HTML and CSS.
This is my first project using Javascript

The game basically provides the player with a tip containing 3 words, the player has to then choose a word from the two given options.
IF the user answers corerctly, the score increases by 1, else it decreases by 1.

Happy Gaming!!
